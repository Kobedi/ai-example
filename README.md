## Spring AI Example

This is a project is based on the tuturial whose link is shown on the relevant articles below
The aim for me was to learn how Spring AI works on a Springboot application. I created two API endpoints that touch on the topic 
of Customer Profiling and another for drilling down on the 3 different customer profiling strategies. I will leave it to you have some fun 
and check how I did it. Thanks to @Baeldung for the wonderful example, it really does give a nice kickstart into Spring AI. 

You will need to provide your own Open AI API Key. Once you have it, just add it to the application.yml. Use the last link to create your 
API Key and then add it as advised. [Add it without the ""]
 

Please feel free to access my own code example, under my github handle below. I am sure you will find a few issues here and there
, that's no problem. I am just also learning like everyone else. See my attempt in  https://github.com/Kobedi/ai-example.git
